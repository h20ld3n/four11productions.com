<b>FILM FESTIVAL ENTRY FEES</b>
<p>  
The entry fee for a film festival should not be more than the budget of the entire film.

<b>USA BABY! AND A LITTLE BIT OF NEW ZEALAND</b>
<p>  
I spent most of January editing and surfing down at Surfers Paradise and Byron Bay, on occasion. 
<p>
The editing was mainly special effect and rotoscoping, which isn’t as hard as I thought. It’s more time consuming than anything else. The short film is coming along and sound is getting really close to being completed. Hopefully there will be a finished product by mid semester break as I need to be thinking about other projects. 
<p>
The surfing has been great in filling the days that I can’t stand to sit in a windowless room and stare at a computer screen. I was surfing two or three times a week prior to heading home for a month. 
<p>
After 18 hours of travel, I landed an hour before left in the cold rain of San Francisco. I have to say BART going all the way to the airport has to be the greatest thing to have happened since I left SF just over a year ago. I picked up a phone at the local Virgin Megastore, greatest sixty bucks I ever spent, and began bothering people at work. I spent the next five days eating, drinking, causing problems, the occasional swing dancing and watching the Superbowl. You haven’t seen the Superbowl till you seen it on a 5ft high def flat television. 
<p>
After 5 days of debauchery it was time for a little detox at home with my parents.
<p>
The detox didn’t last too long as 2 days later I was headed to Atlanta to spend time with my sister, and two friends who have been fighting or not speaking since high school. Just a quick note: Always check which airport your leaving from.  Needless to say everyone was a bit nervous. Everything went down smoothly as far as I can see. Blake was early, Sean was late, and we all went out and got drunk, or I got drunk and proceeded to pass out a strip club. 
<p>
On a side note why would I leave a club, when I am dancing with a semi hot girl who I probably won’t go home with and to go to a club and pay money to a naked girl who I know I am not going home with. 
<p>
After 48 hours in Atlanta, which was a ton of fun and helped get me one step closer to being a full-blown alcoholic, it was time to head back to my parents. There is nothing sweater or sadder than spending Valentines Day with your mom. 
<p>
After an eventful day of watching movies on my parent’s new large plasma TV, I headed back to the West Coast to finish off my tour of the States. After a 24 hour stint in SF, I headed down to Los Angeles, were I watched some of the Olympics with Sarah, took blue pictures of Noel, had breakfast with Johanna, watched Christy work on set, and got lost in the City of Orange and finished the whole weekend off with drinks at the Dresden. Then I was back in San Francisco for two more days of trouble. 
<p>
Thanks to my uncle and co. for putting up with me for a night and feeding me before my 13 hour, which turned into 15 hours flight to NZ. My random friend Tom and his roommates put me up for a couple of days. Another special thanks to Tom and Co. for all the goodies and the CD, which rocks by the way.
<p>
My apologies to all those i didn't get to hang out with or drunk dialed, and thanks to all those who let me sleep on futons, couches, or whatever.

<b>TOTALLY CRAZY</b>
<p>  
The past few months have been totally crazy.<br>
Finished another short film. A comedy. Apparently it a Farrelly Brothers knock off, which is ok. Some thought it was suitable for their 14-year-old daughters, which is ok. Some said they actually laughed, which is great. If you laugh once during a 10 min student film with no budget, I figure that’s awesome.
<p>  
If you haven’t seen it you should totally check out <A HREF="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.four11productions.com/051104_kiki.html','kiki','width=420,height=340,scrollbars=no')">Hurry Kiki Hurry</a>.
<p>  
Kiki was screened with 8 other films at an actually movie theatre, yes that’s right a big movie theatre, just after the semester ended. I have to say it’s pretty awesome to see your name 10 feet across. It was a great night judging by the headache I had the next morning. 
<p>  
Not one to sit on my laurels, less than a week after the screening of one film, it was time to shoot another. This time it was my own creation. Everyone tells you not to work with kids and animals. I would have to say just animals. Kids aren’t as bad as I had imagined. You tell them to do something and they do it. How cool is that. The shoot had everything rain back flips, stunts and of course, the steady cam. This was also my first attempt at setting up events as it is. I see why action films are so much fun to work on, especially when you have eager actors and crew. 
<p>  
The film is now being edited. I can hardly wait. Hopefully it will be finished in March. So be prepared for the second most thrilling 5 minutes of your life, and you’ll be able to experience it over and over and over, the only problem is it won’t ever get any longer. Course you could watch it in slow mo, which might be cool. 
<p>  
Lets see what else...oh yeah. 
<p>  
My buddy or mate, with out the last part of the “t” as they say downunder, came to visit. So we ended up taking a trip down the coast. Surfing and stopping at every beach along the way. Newcastle by far has the best surf, but Bondi has the best beaches. How can you go wrong with topless women? I have found my second favorite city in the world. Between the scaling the Harbor Bridge, Green Day, and pancakes and beer on the rocks, it was pretty awesome.
I think my surfing is getting better. Accidentally ended up at Surfers Paradise on Boxing Day and had a blast surfing. I can make a slow turn and dodge other surfers on the long board. Hopefully I will be able to get out there at least once a week.
<p>  
Just want to thanks the all the friends and family who have help and encouraged the dream.

<b>BAD TEETH</b>
<p>
As he stood there confronting me, screaming at me, calling me female body parts, I wondered if he noticed me trying to keep my coffee cup from shaking. I like to think it was the hangover I was nursing. Who confronts someone at 8 in the morning anyway? God, he had really bad teeth. The teeth of and Englishman or maybe a Scotsman. Not sure what I am suppose to say to a guy that runs into bus stops while trying to pick a fight.

<b>3 WEEKS IN CHINA</b>
<p>
Three weeks ago I got on a plane, with an book full of erotic short stories headed for a brief stop in Hong Kong then two and half weeks in Beijing. As I walked down the corridor, and the stewardess assumed I was an idiot, repeating my seat number to me, my head was filled with all these romantic ideas about what the next three weeks would be like. 
<p>
Visions of small men and women wearing ancient Chinese littered with writing I didn’t understand, bowing around majestic temples of leaders who were now dead and gone. This is not the China that I found. 
<p>
The small people of Beijing are romantically polite, honorable, and overly concerned with saving face. These were my fathers’ students who I found loved to drink as much as any other group. But in their romantic honorable and face saving ways, they toast before any all drinks. The rest of the world that I have seen has simplified the entire process. I do like the toasting, give you an excuse to drink outside of the obvious ones, you’re always celebrating something. Nothing bad can come from celebrating. The last week I seem to recall a lot of celebrating.
<p>
Why not celebrate the country it's full of things they should be proud of, and things they are proud of. I had been walking around with the family for a couple of days, when we decided to Tienemen Square, to see the Forbidden City and Mao’s Tomb. The officials did not let you take anything inside Mao’s Tomb. For good reason to, it’s a sacred place. No pictures or bags or anything are aloud inside. In chilly tomb you walk by his body under glass, surrounded by flowers and other religious symbols. The whole thing maybe takes five minutes. The as you walk back into the warm sun you are hit by a barrage of people selling trinkets and baubles. So much for the somber and respectful mood I was in. 
<p>
This barrage continues not only at the historical monuments, but in the Hutongs or neighbor hoods were you bight expect it but as well as the malls. You walk through the mall, which is like any mall in the states, except people are yelling at you in a language you don’t understand. They seem to yell louder at Americans then anyone else apparently I am deaf as well as stupid. Once they have coerced you inside, you are followed and tracked like wounded prey. It is at this moment that you can either try to escape or you can accept your fate and have fun with it. 
<p>
I more often chose to have fun with it. It helps being 2 meters tall as well but the game is the same. First walk around the store extremely interested in nearly everything. Picking up and handling anything that strikes your fancy and a few things that don’t. Begin to hand these over to the person following you. As soon as you have collected enough items to make carrying them around the store difficult, start eliminating items, one by one. You should save the items you really like till the end. Now bargaining begins. Whatever price they want you should offer a quarter of that, and only budge to half of the original offer. When you get to a price that your happy with, leave the store. You won’t make it out the door and you will have something you didn’t need in the first place. Don’t feel bad though you probably got it for a fraction of the cost. 
<p>
Despite all the pushing and shoving, the people of Beijing are amazing. They are overly romantic in all aspects and you have to love them for that.

<b>HOPEFULLY BAZ LUHRMANN IS RIGHT</b>
<p>
The other night I woke up at 4am really thirsty. I laid awake what seemed like hours listening to my housemate snore. As she vibrated the wall with her nasal exhaust, my mind began to drift, as it does at in the wee hours of the morning. 
<p>
As my mind wandered through druken parties, making an ass of myself, I became very insecure, wandering if I had made the right decision.  
<p>
“Don’t be reckless with other peoples hearts…” <br>
I have tried to do this but feel that I have failed everytime I have truly loved someone.
<p>
“Don’t waste your time on jealousy, sometimes your ahead, sometimes your behind, the race is long and in the end it’s only with yourself.”<br>  
It seems that everyone else I know or knew has some direction of is at least secure enough in their position in life. Maybe its my age, but when down that stop being a justification. I figure eventually that excuse will come around again but then I will be old. I often wonder if I am cut out for design or film making. Everyone seems to think so or at least that’s what they tell me. Everywhere I go people seem to love my work but I seem to be unemployable
<p>
“Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know, didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. some of the most interesting 40 year olds still don’t.”
<p>
I have been in Australia just over 5 months. I am going to school. I have a part time job designing ads. I have completed my first real short movie, and have another 2-3 in the works. I guess I am just worried about the pressure that has been placed on this adventure. 
<p>

<b>CRAPPY DAY</b>
<p>
Today I think I had my first really shitty day here in Australia. Woke up this morning really tired and a little stressed. I have a film shoot in a little over a week with nowhere to actually shoot it, but that’s pretty standard and I was working on getting a location, it was under control, I think. 
<p>
Stumbling down the stairs I made some coffee and got ready for work. Getting into my full Arête gear, I ride the 30mins to work. Yeah I know what your saying 30min to work means 30mins back. Which on Wednesdays means I spend an hour getting to and from work for a 3 hours shift. Kind of silly. Anyway I walk in this morning and apparently my boss decides that my facial hair is unsightly, so he sends me home. So I was at work all of 30min. That’s right math wiz. It took longer to commute than to actually work. So I headed home, the whole time thinking how is it possible that I moved 11,000 miles and still end up working for a child. So needless to say, I thought the last hour and half had been a complete waste of time. 
<p>
So then I head to Uni. Figure might as well get some work done. I have a lot of storyboard to do for the shoot that doesn’t have a location yet. When I get to to Uni. I break my favorite pair of sunglasses. Which isn’t that bad I figure they are 3 years old but its like salt in the wound. 
<p>
So not much else happens except my notebook opens up and all the pages fall out, oh and when I get home found out my Wog of a boss decided that my unsightly facial hair was grounds for dismissal. 
<p>
Well I guess its back to being a full time student. In the words of my Kiwi roomie "Hooraaaay!"

<b>HAPPY APRIL FOOLS DAY</b>
<p>
It's been a while since i wrote last. Really begining to find my place here. 
<p>
<b>Easter Weekend At Byron Bay</b>
<p>
Got up early on Saturday through on the “boardies” and headed for the beach, after asking around found the best place to surf was a place called “The Pass” or “Watego.”  Watego was a bit further down the road but well worth the extra trek. I caught  a ton of waves and since the water wasn’t cold I could stay in all day, excepts for the occasional coffee and “wedges” break. After surfing all day I decided to hang out on the beach and watch the waves roll in and out. After about an hour in a euphoric state I stood to start the journey to the tent and food, only to find it a bit breezy. Aparently at some point in the day my “boardies” had ripped open and my bum was in the open. Luckily or unluckily I have no idea at what point in the day, my ass was in full view. This may however explain why I was able to get waves all to myself. So now I was off to the surf shop to buy some boardies. Luckily for me they had a 50% off deal going on. So I got two pairs and continued on my way. 

Woke up Sunday and thought sweet I have a couple hours till the board has to be back, I have a brand new pair of boardies, so I can go catch some more waves. I was so raw from the previous day (invest in a rash guard) that I was only able to stand the pain my chest rubbing against the wax salt and fiber glass for 30 min but I did catch one wave and walked to have coffee and the biggest muffin I have ever seen no wonder it cost 5.00 and returned the board. Feeling satisfied with myself I met up with Oz and co and we were headed home after a quick stop for some pints at surfers paradise that is. 
<p>
<b>My First Film Shoot</b>
<p>
I have been doing some filming and editing with my week off from school, you should check out the digital video section of my website when you get a chance. 
<p>
Shot the our first film for school which was a huge learning experience, byt really fun. There is this one girl, who shall remain nameless, she wants to control everything, and won't let anyone do their job, but she will be a good addition once we can get her to stick with the story boards and not waster time trying to re-write the story on set. So, a little crazy at first but we finally got it done. The shoot toook 6 hours for a 90sec movie, hopefully that will get better.

<b>Let me just get the mushy stuff out of the way:</b>
<p>
Leaving San Francisco and everything that I know and loved on February 3rd for adventures in Australia was the hardest thing I have ever done. 
<p>
<b>Now the cool stuff:</b>
<p>
Seems the Qantas is pretty strict about their 70lbs weight limit on the plane, they acquired a large number of Clif Shots (which seem to weigh more than one would think). If you must travel internationally, I highly recommend business class. I was upgraded for the long flight. Talk about a fish out of water, free champaigne when you board, a choice of meals none of which shrink wrapped, being referred to as Mr Hardcastle, a little weird, there was something about a reach around but I passed on that complimentary service. 
<p>
Landing 15 hours later, in the one place that is just as hilly as San Francisco, not feeling all that refreshed, even with the little hand towel, I was headed for temporary accomodations, a converted walk in closet. I was off to find more suitable housing. Well after looking at several places that were “dodgy” with 2 Aussie girls who helped me find my way & invited me to a party, (I had only been in the country 4hrs) I found my new home with a grad-student from Los Angeles, a Kiwi drummer and Chinese girl who speaks very little English, but she’s learning. 
<p>
A week later and 10lbs lighter (its really hot here), when I was able to move in I had come across the local bike scene, which is a lot of sprinting, for two hours then sitting and drinking coffee for 2hrs. Needless to say road races are not overly popular in Brisbane, but I am looking forward to next years track season. The facilites no matter what sport you into are amazing. The only draw back is everything happens between 5 and 6 am. 
<p>
I think am the oldest person on campus and just because your in a bar doesn’t mean everyone is 21 (the drinking age is 18, haven’t figure out if that’s a good thing or a bad thing). Having been stung by a jelly fish, discovering rides beautiful rides and runs, waiting to see my first living kangaroo, picking up the lingo, and finally getting over jetlag I am having a great time here. </font>
